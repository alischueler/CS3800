STEPS OF ALGORITHM
1. Read the xml file of a NSDFA and create a representation of it based on the below
2. Convert the NSDFA to an NFA by adding a new start state with epsilon transitions to the start states of the DSDFA
3. Convert the NFA to a DFA using the NFA->DFA file from homework 3
4. Construct an xml output of the DFA to print

DATA TYPES
# DFA Data Representation:
A State has an id and a name
an id is a String
a name is an String
A DFATransition has a from, to read
from is a String representing the state the transition is starting at
to is a String representing the state the transition is ending at
read is a String representing the value the value read off the input for the transition
A Symbol is a String of length 1
A DFA is a (states, alphabet, delta, start state, accept states) where:
 - states is a List of State
 - alphabet is a List of Symbols
 - Delta is a List of DFATransitions
 - start state is a State
 - accept states is a List of State

#NFA Data Representation
A State has an id and a name
an id is a String
a name is an String
A DFATransition has a from, to read
from is a String representing the state the transition is starting at
to is a String representing the state the transition is ending at
read is a String representing the value the value read off the input for the transition
A Symbol is a String of length 1
A NFA is a (states, alphabet, delta, start state, accept states) where:
 - states is a List of State
 - alphabet is a List of Symbols
 - Delta is a List of DFA Transitions
 - start state is a State
