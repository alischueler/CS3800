The reduction from UNDIRHAMPATH to UNDIRHAMCIRCUIT:
G is a undirected graph, with a hamiltonian path
The following machine F computes a reduction f.
F="On input <G>:
	1. Create a new undirected graph G', that has all the Vertices and Edges of graph G
	2. Add a new vertex Vnew to graph G', and edges connecting it to every other vertex in graph G'
	3. Count the number of Nodes in graph G and set this to v
	4. Pick a node s, that is not Vnew, this will be the starting and ending node
	5. Place a mark on node s
	6. Pick a node connected to s, set this as node t
	7. Repeat the following until no additional nodes are marked
	8. Scan all edges of graph G'. If an edge (a,b) is found going from a marked node a to an unmarked node b and unmarked node b is not t or Vnew, or unmarked node b is t and we have marked v-1 nodes, mark node b. 
	9. Traverse path (t, Vnew), marking Vnew
	10. Traverse path (Vnew, s), ending the circuit where it started at node s
	11. Output the undirected Graph G' that has a Hamiltonian Circuit"
