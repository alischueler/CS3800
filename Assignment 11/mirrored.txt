The reduction from A_TM to R shows R is undecidable, because A_TM is undecidable.

The following machine F computes a reduction f.
F="On input <M, x>:
	1. Construct the following machine M'
	   M' = "On input w:
		1. Compute r, the reverse of input string w
		2. Run M on w and r
		3. If M accepts on w and r, accept
		4. If M rejects on w, r, or both w and r, then reject"
	2. Output <M', w>"
